OF COURSE NOT, YOU DUMBASS! Go back to the basics.
Compiler doesn't allow private methods to leak out to other classes, but always remember...
Access modifiers have nothing to do with security. In fact you can and should look at access modifiers as the reverse of security -- it is not to protect your data or algorithims, it is to protect people from the requirement to know about your data and algorithims. This is why the default modifier is package -- if they are working on the package they probably already need to know.
