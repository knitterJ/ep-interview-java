Composition and inheritance are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming that allow for code reuse and the creation of complex software systems. The main difference between composition and inheritance is how objects are related to each other.

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class is derived from another class, allowing the derived class to inherit the methods and properties of the base class. The derived class can also add its own methods and properties or override the inherited ones. Inheritance is a "is-a" relationship, where the derived class is a specialized version of the base class. For example, a "Car" class can inherit from a "Vehicle" class, as a car is a type of vehicle.

Composition, on the other hand, is a mechanism in which a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes, allowing the class to use the methods and properties of the composed objects. Composition is a "has-a" relationship, where the class has an object of another class as a member variable. For example, a "Car" class can have a "Engine" class as a member variable, as a car has an engine.

Here are some key differences between composition and inheritance:

    Inheritance is a mechanism for code reuse by deriving new classes from existing ones, while composition is a mechanism for code reuse by combining existing classes in new ways.
    Inheritance creates a tight coupling between the derived class and the base class, while composition allows for looser coupling between objects.
    Inheritance can lead to code duplication if multiple derived classes need to override the same methods, while composition avoids this problem by delegating responsibilities to composed objects.
    Inheritance is more suitable for creating hierarchies of related classes with a shared interface, while composition is more suitable for creating complex objects from smaller, reusable components.
